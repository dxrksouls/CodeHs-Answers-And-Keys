First off dynamically typed code is less complicated and is extremely easy to write down but is still a little confusing while in other hand statically typed code is way more complex and has alot more code written in it.
Examples:


Dynamically Typed:
x = 10
print(type(x))    # Output: <class 'int'>

x = "hello"
print(type(x))    # Output: <class 'str'>




Statically Typed:
public class MyProgram
{
    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
        int x = 10;     // x is an integer
        String message = "Hello";   // message is a string
    }
}
